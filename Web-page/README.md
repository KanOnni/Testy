# Express REST API with MongoDB

This project is a RESTful API built with **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. It provides endpoints for managing products, users, orders, and order items. The app uses **Mongoose** for database interaction and includes essential middleware such as logging, CORS handling, and error management.

## Features

- CRUD operations for products, users, orders, and order items.
- MongoDB database connection using **Mongoose**.
- Error handling and logging with **morgan**.
- CORS support for cross-origin requests.
- Environment variable configuration using **dotenv**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **MongoDB** instance (local or remote)
